# bee_detector

This repository contains the YOLOv8n model from Ultralytics an retrained on data from https://universe.roboflow.com/apisinaturalist2/apis_inaturalist_2

The goal of this project is to create a model and a gui to upload camera trap footage of bees to extract frames in which bees are detected. This will provide researchers with the technology to study behaviors of bees and reduce video analysis time from hours to seconds ultimately saving days of manual video analyzing and frame extracting.
